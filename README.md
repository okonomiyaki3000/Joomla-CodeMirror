# CodeMirror - Joomla Editor

But Joomla already has CodeMirror built in...

Yes but the version of CodeMirror used in Joomla 2.5 is very old and will never be updated. If you are using Joomla 2.5 and don't plan to update to 3+ in the near future, you'll be stuck with that old version. You don't have to be. Just install this nifty extension. It will overwrite the built in version and give you all the features of the latest (I'll try to keep it up to date) version.
