# CodeMirror - Joomla Editor

But Joomla already has CodeMirror built in...

Yes but the version of CodeMirror used in Joomla 2.5 is very old and will never be updated. If you are using Joomla 2.5 and don't plan to update to 3+ in the near future, you'll be stuck with that old version. You don't have to be. Just install this nifty extension. It will overwrite the built in version and give you all the features of the latest (I'll try to keep it up to date) version. 

## How to install

This plugin installs like any normal Joomla extension. So, just clone or download this repo, then go to the Joomla extensions manager and put the path to `plg_editors_codemirror` in the field under 'Install from Directory' and click install. Alternatively, you may prefer to upload a package file to install. In that case, just zip the `plg_editors_codemirror` directory and upload that. 

## How to use

For details about what CodeMirror is and how to use it, please see the official site: http://codemirror.net/

This plugin does offer several new and different options from Joomla's usual preinstalled CodeMirror plugin. Open the CodeMirror plugin in the Joomla Plug-in Manager to change these settings.

- Basic options that you can switch `on` or `off` include Line Number, Code Folding, Gutters, Active Line Highlight, Tag Matching, Bracket Matching, Tag Completion, Auto Focus, and Vim Keybinding.
- CodeMirror now features a full-screen mode which you can activate using an F-key of your choice plus zero or more modifiers. 
- All of the default CodeMirror color themes are included. This includes both light and dark themes. 
- Active line and matching tag highlight colors can be configured. This is mainly because it's difficult or impossible to find a single hightlight color which is suitable for both light and dark themes.
- The editor font can be selected from any of the monospaced fonts offered by Google's font hosting service. Font size and line height may also be adjusted.
